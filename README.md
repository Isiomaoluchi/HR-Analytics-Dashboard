# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project explores the factors driving employee exits from organizations, leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle. By examining trends in attrition across various demographics (gender, age, job levels, and departments), it sheds light on key pain points like workplace dissatisfaction, high-pressure roles, and inadequate work-life balance. The analysis highlights areas for improvement, such as mentorship, enriched roles, and transformative training programs, aiming to reduce employee turnover and foster a more engaged workforce.

This initiative is a stepping stone in understanding the dynamic factors of employee retention, combining data insights with actionable HR strategies to create better workplaces.

## Data Source
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

## Tools
Power Query
PowerBi

## Data cleaning 
Data cleaning was performed through these steps:
1. Splitting data in columns
2. Changing data type
3. Perfomed conditional columns
4. Also performed column from example
5. New measures were added in Powerbi

## Data Analysis
1.  What is the difference between attrition and turnover, and why does it matter?
2.  Why do males dominate the attrition statistics in the analyzed dataset?
3.  What age group has the highest attrition rate, and why is this concerning?
4.  What challenges do frequent travelers face, contributing to higher attrition rates?
5.  Why does the sales department struggle with high attrition rates?
6.  What factors contribute to low job satisfaction and high attrition?
7.  How does work-life balance (or the lack of it) impact employee retention?


## Finding and Result
1. Attrition and turnover both refer to employees leaving an organization, but the difference lies in the cause. Attrition often occurs passively, such as through retirements or employees leaving voluntarily without immediate replacement. Turnover can be more dynamic, involving firings, layoffs, or quick replacements. It matters because understanding the root cause helps HR professionals design better retention strategies and minimize unnecessary exits.
2. The analysis suggests that males might be leaving due to better opportunities or unresolved workplace dynamics. It raises questions about whether the organization is addressing their career growth, engagement, and satisfaction.
3. The 18-25 age group had the highest attrition rate. This is concerning because it represents fresh talentâ€”digital natives and innovative thinkers who could be the future leaders of the organization. Losing them suggests potential issues in onboarding, career pathing, or workplace culture.
4. Frequent travelers often deal with burnout, inadequate stipends, and insufficient downtime. Constant travel can feel overwhelming and unsustainable, leading to dissatisfaction and eventual exit from the company.
5. Sales roles often come with high-pressure targets and limited appreciation, resulting in overwork and stress. These factors make it difficult to retain talent in this department, as employees seek less stressful opportunities elsewhere.
6. Low job involvement and low job satisfaction are key factors. Employees who don't feel connected to their roles or see their work as meaningful are more likely to leave. Even high salaries cannot compensate for a lack of engagement and purpose.
7. Poor work-life balance, long hours, and subpar training programs make employees feel like they're merely surviving rather than thriving. This dissatisfaction drives them to seek better opportunities, further fueling attrition.


## Recommendation
To reduce attrition, organizations should focus on:
1. Mentorship programs to support career growth.
2. Improved work-life balance initiatives.
3. Enriching or redesigning roles to make them more fulfilling.
4. Transformative training and development programs to equip employees with meaningful skills.


## Summary
In conclusion, addressing employee attrition goes beyond merely reducing turnover; it's about cultivating an environment where employees feel valued, engaged, and supported. From tackling burnout to improving work-life balance and career development, organizations must proactively identify and resolve root causes. By investing in people, fostering growth, and prioritizing well-being, companies can turn the tide and build a workplace that retains talent and drives collective success.
